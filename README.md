# KNN Implementation with Weighted Euclidean Distance

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with a weighted Euclidean distance function in R. It uses a dataset named `Invistico_Airline.csv` to predict customer satisfaction based on various features. The script also includes hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal value of `k` using the elbow method.

## Requirements

- **R (version 3.5 or higher)**
- **ggplot2 library**

## Installation

To install the required package, use the following command in R:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## Screenshots of the project have been uploaded above.
